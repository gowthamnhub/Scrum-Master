Introduction
-------------
	What we will learn in this course?
		1. we would be learning about Scrum theory and the role of Scrum Master.
		2. How can we apply the Scrum framework in practice,
			-> To do this, we will have a fictional team, client who task us with building a website
			-> By learning the scrum theory we are going to introduce Scrum to the team, setting up the scrum events and running the first sprint.
		2. Preparing for the PSM 1 certification
			-> At the very end of the course, there are several pratice exam questions related to PSM 1 assessment.
			
Ok, here is our team of interns. Designing website for BIKE CLUB...

				-> Scrum master (YOU!!!!)
				-> Front end developer
				-> Back end developer
				-> Designer - who designs the website to meet the customer's needs
				-> Product Owner - who has the range of experience with the customer business (bike club) and put in charge of owning the product and make sure it is of value.
				
	Unfortunately, BIKE CLUB is not very clear on their requirements, it can be easily predicted they can change once the work begins. 
		-> So for all these reason, you have been told to follow the Agile Principles and Scrum Framework, so you can build iteratively and adapt as needed.
		-> Though you have some project experience, but you do not know anything about Agile and Scrum, neither the team of interns.
		
SCRUM in Under 5 Minutes
-------------------------
	What is Agile?
		Agile is a project management/development approach which doesn't prescribe process/steps to follow but a mindset that focusses more on collaboration, adaptability, iterative progress on development and delivering value to customers.
		
	-> Scrum is one of the framework within Agile to help follow, achieve the Agile Principles.
		-> It has more of structured way/process/steps to follow to achieve the Agile principles Adaptability, Customer Focus, Quality.
		
		Scrum does follow time boxed sprints to perform iterative development.
		Generally the team following scrum, sprint based development must have required skills to complete the assigned or committed items for the respective sprint.
			Speaking of team, it should have;
			---------------------------------
				PO - who owns the product, manages the backlog to add value to the product.
					-> Accountable for maximising the value of the product.
					
				Scrum master 
					-> helps coach the team to work better in the Scrum Framework, follow scrum principles, remove impediments in following the scrum
					-> mostly work with team to understand where we stand in completing the items, if any blockers and resolve.
					-> to work with PO to align the backlog, sprint board based on the team's capacity and with the goals that to be achieved/completed
					-> Coach team with different trainings for better communication within / across teams, for the agile mindset.
					-> Analyze different charts to understand how as a team we are performing.
					-> Prepare for next planning, retrospective meetings, sprint reviews/demos
					-> Daily standups.
					-> Make sure the team is engaged and not diverted from the committed ones, through any external requests ensure it is not affecting the team.
					
				Developers
					-> Who actually develops the product and its increments.
				
			OK, now we have sprint, and the team who work in it, and the increments are created.
		
		How do we get it reviewed with the business stakeholders/customers?	
		---------------------------------------------------------------------
			-> That is why we have Sprint Review at the end of every sprint, this is part of the scrum framework itself.
			-> Here the stakeholders/customers can view what has been completed and provide their feedback which team can take it into their next sprints.
			
		How do we discuss the lessons learned in sprint/improvements that needed for the next sprints?
		------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			-> This is "Sprint Retrospective" meeting this happens at the end of sprint, to discuss with team what went well, not well, any issues, how can we improve process and Quality.
		
		How do we plan for the sprint? how do we pick work for the sprint?
		-------------------------------------------------------------------
			-> This is "Sprint Planning" where team sits with PO to pick the work for the next sprint from Product Backlog
			-> So from "Product Backlog" -> Sprint Planning -> "Sprint Backlog" where team would pick work from 
				
				"To-do -> In Progress -> Acceptance Review -> Definition of done -> Completed"
				
		How does one let team/PO/Scrum master know what is done yesterday? what is planned for today? any issues/blockers?
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			-> This is "Daily Scrum/ Standup" meeting to know if they are on track for the sprint's goal.
			
What are the effective things that a Scrum Master can do to make better team? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-> To make every meeting conducted relevant with clear agenda, as short and crisp so that the message need to be conveyed/discussed are effectively done.
		-> Standups - mostly within 15mins.
		-> if something is going off topic, ensure organize it better way or make it a seperate meeting after stand up.
	
	-> Have a goal for the sprint, that what is going to be completed after the sprint, and ensure team is well aware of the sprint goal on a higher level than individual tasks and make them understand why they need to own their tasks efficiently to achieve the bigger goal that is sprint goal.
	
	-> Ensure team is well focussed and not diverted because of any other requests/tasks coming mid sprint/after the sprint started.
	
	-> Ensure team do not get bored of any repetetive work, keep mix of work/challenges which can help them grow as well, organize environment for better collaboration/trainings sessions.
		-> For eg: If only one person is doing QE, we can have someone paired up with QE rotatively to ensure new functionalities are learned by team across.

	-> Ensure sprint retrospectives are effectively involving team to share their thoughts, instead of what went well/didn't like, make it more interactive/engaging way.
			-> I think this is important event to make team collaborative if we make it very engaging and interesting.
				But how do we do? Lets think.............
				
	-> Can organize Skill Building Sessions / Team building activities - 
			-> Probably some online games, coffee chats, or even small celebrations for sprint completions
			
-> To make effective retro, one of the different approach that can be done is STOP, START, CONTINUE for each person what they would like to START/STOP/CONTINUE in the next sprint....
			-> But need to see how effectively this can be incorporated in the retro to the team so that they really accept it.
			
The SCRUM GUIDE - https://scrumguides.org/
				-> Ultimate study guide to prepare for the PSM 1 exam. Relatively short document, but need in detail understanding of the document to clear the exam, it looks like the exam cost is around 23k ~ 27k.
				
PURPOSE OF THE SCRUM GUIDE:
===========================				
				
	Scrum is framework developed by "Ken Schwaber & Jeff Sutherland" way back in 1990s, over the period it has been kept incrementally updated which is core spirit of Scrum, meaning they follow what they preach.

	Initially it is designed/developed for software development, but it is currently being followed across industries.
	Every element of scrum is essential and must be followed, omitting any could cover up the problems, and the benefit of scrum could not be realised.

	Ok now what I think is this course is talking about the points/details from scrum guide, as we have taken print, lets go through it tomorrow. 
		-> Get something out of it.
		-> Then with that small knowledge we can go through further to increase the knowledge.
		
	I can sense once we complete the Scrum Guide, we will already have a kind of better overall understanding, further expanding knowledge on it.

SCRUM DEFINITION
================
	"Scrum" is  light weight framework that helps the team, organization and stakeholders generate value through adapative solutions to complex problems.
	
	The major duty of "Scrum Master" is to foster(raise, cultivate) an environment where;
		
		-> Product Owner can create a set of work for the "Complex Problems" (Probably the business problem faced by Customer)
		-> The Scrum team turns a selection of work in to a increment of value during a sprint.
		-> The Scrum team and its Stakeholders (POs, PMGs, Architects, other teams) inspects the results and make adjustment for the next sprint.
		-> Repeat...
		
	-> Scrum is purposely incomplete, just defining the essential parts/events to implement the scrum theory.
	-> Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of people using it, rather than providing detail instructions, the scrum guide their roles,relationships and interactions.
	-> Various processes can be employed within the scrum framework until it adds value, if not it can be removed.
	-> Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy(efficieny)of the team, management, processes, environment and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.
	
		This summarizes Scrum in nutshell:
		-----------------------------------
			Complex Problem -> PO orders the work as product backlog -> Team selects a bit of work and complete it in sprint -> Reviewed and inspected by team and stakeholders -> Adjust for the next sprint -> Proceed
			
		We will look at more about Agile Manifesto and Agile Principles later in the course, but if possible its better to read it sooner as possible as its worth the read.
		
	Lets see and learn more about Scrum Master and the Roles within the Scrum team.

Scrum Glossary
===============
		Here we can find the meanings of various scrum terms like (Burn up, Burn down, Sprint planning, sprint retrospective, review, sprint, scrum master, scrum team, velocity etc..,
