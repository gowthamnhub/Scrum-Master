Introduction
-------------
	What we will learn in this course?
		1. we would be learning about Scrum theory and the role of Scrum Master.
		2. How can we apply the Scrum framework in practice,
			-> To do this, we will have a fictional team, client who task us with building a website
			-> By learning the scrum theory we are going to introduce Scrum to the team, setting up the scrum events and running the first sprint.
		2. Preparing for the PSM 1 certification
			-> At the very end of the course, there are several pratice exam questions related to PSM 1 assessment.
			
Ok, here is our team of interns. Designing website for BIKE CLUB...

				-> Scrum master (YOU!!!!)
				-> Front end developer
				-> Back end developer
				-> Designer - who designs the website to meet the customer's needs
				-> Product Owner - who has the range of experience with the customer business (bike club) and put in charge of owning the product and make sure it is of value.
				
	Unfortunately, BIKE CLUB is not very clear on their requirements, it can be easily predicted they can change once the work begins. 
		-> So for all these reason, you have been told to follow the Agile Principles and Scrum Framework, so you can build iteratively and adapt as needed.
		-> Though you have some project experience, but you do not know anything about Agile and Scrum, neither the team of interns.
		
SCRUM in Under 5 Minutes
-------------------------
	What is Agile?
		Agile is a project management/development approach which doesn't prescribe process/steps to follow but a mindset that focusses more on collaboration, adaptability, iterative progress on development and delivering value to customers.
		
	-> Scrum is one of the framework within Agile to help follow, achieve the Agile Principles.
		-> It has more of structured way/process/steps to follow to achieve the Agile principles Adaptability, Customer Focus, Quality.
		
		Scrum does follow time boxed sprints to perform iterative development.
		Generally the team following scrum, sprint based development must have required skills to complete the assigned or committed items for the respective sprint.
			Speaking of team, it should have;
			---------------------------------
				PO - who owns the product, manages the backlog to add value to the product.
					-> Accountable for maximising the value of the product.
					
				Scrum master 
					-> helps coach the team to work better in the Scrum Framework, follow scrum principles, remove impediments in following the scrum
					-> mostly work with team to understand where we stand in completing the items, if any blockers and resolve.
					-> to work with PO to align the backlog, sprint board based on the team's capacity and with the goals that to be achieved/completed
					-> Coach team with different trainings for better communication within / across teams, for the agile mindset.
					-> Analyze different charts to understand how as a team we are performing.
					-> Prepare for next planning, retrospective meetings, sprint reviews/demos
					-> Daily standups.
					-> Make sure the team is engaged and not diverted from the committed ones, through any external requests ensure it is not affecting the team.
					
				Developers
					-> Who actually develops the product and its increments.
				
			OK, now we have sprint, and the team who work in it, and the increments are created.
		
		How do we get it reviewed with the business stakeholders/customers?	
		---------------------------------------------------------------------
			-> That is why we have Sprint Review at the end of every sprint, this is part of the scrum framework itself.
			-> Here the stakeholders/customers can view what has been completed and provide their feedback which team can take it into their next sprints.
			
		How do we discuss the lessons learned in sprint/improvements that needed for the next sprints?
		------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			-> This is "Sprint Retrospective" meeting this happens at the end of sprint, to discuss with team what went well, not well, any issues, how can we improve process and Quality.
		
		How do we plan for the sprint? how do we pick work for the sprint?
		-------------------------------------------------------------------
			-> This is "Sprint Planning" where team sits with PO to pick the work for the next sprint from Product Backlog
			-> So from "Product Backlog" -> Sprint Planning -> "Sprint Backlog" where team would pick work from 
				
				"To-do -> In Progress -> Acceptance Review -> Definition of done -> Completed"
				
		How does one let team/PO/Scrum master know what is done yesterday? what is planned for today? any issues/blockers?
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			-> This is "Daily Scrum/ Standup" meeting to know if they are on track for the sprint's goal.
